Bot invite link: https://tinyurl.com/PaLM2-DiscordBot

Make sure you replace the PaLM 2 API key and Discord bot token with yours as well as the bot ID.

Ping the bot to chat with it. It has a default memory lenght of 50 messages - 25 user inputs and 25 bot responses per user before it starts deleting.

Context is a "system message" that will tell the bot how to act, and the examples are ways that the bot is supposed to respond to certain inputs.

Temperature is a value between 0 and 1 that sets the randomness. Set it to 0 for completely random outputs, and 1 for it to follow the context the best.
